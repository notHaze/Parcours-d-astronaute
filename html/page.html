            <p>The station was a large spheroid structure 160 km in diameter and featured 560 internal levels which
              could contain 2,471,647 passengers and crew. Significantly larger than the previous Death Star, the Death
              Star II would be approximately 3% the size of the Sanctuary Moon. A large concave dish in the station's
              northern hemisphere housed its <a href="#">superlaser</a>. Like
              its predecessor, a <a href="#">throne room</a> would
              be installed for the Galactic Emperor.</p>

            <p>Owing to the station's stationary and not synchronous orbit, it required a tremendous force to counter
              Endor's gravity. Utilizing the repulsorlift field created by the <a
                href="#">shield generator</a> on Endor to
              maintain its position, the Death Star II created earthquakes, tidal imbalances, and other geological
              disturbances on the surface below.</p>

            <p>The most prominent weapon on the Death Star II was its impressive superlaser, which unlike the original
              Death Star only had a three minute recharge time. Powered by the station's hypermatter reactors, the
              superlaser would focus multiple lasers through massive green kyber crystals into a single destructive
              beam. For point-defense capabilities, it featured 15,000 heavy and standard turbolaser batteries along
              with 7,500 laser cannons and 5,000 ion cannons. It housed 768 tractor beam emplacements, as well as
              complements of <a href="#">TIE/LN starfighters</a> and
              their variants for space-based encounters and a plethora of <a
                href="#">AT-AT</a> and <a

            <p>With the destruction of the first Death Star in the <a
                href="#">Yavin system</a>, the Empire was left in a
              vertiginous state as the <a href="#">Imperial
                Military</a> reeled at such a sizable loss of its martial forces. With the dissolution of the <a
                href="#">Imperial Senate</a> and increasing pirate and
              rebel attacks, the Emperor immediately began construction on a new and improved battle station, one more
              powerful and without the fatal flaw of its predecessor. 
              <img src="../img/training.png" alt="photo placement holder" height="200px" width="auto" style="padding: 0 39%;" ></br>
              To ameliorate the failings of the previous
              station, Emperor Palpatine executed the Originser responsible for the first station's weak spot, then
              cloned him to make the second station without any imperfections. Upon the station's completion, the
              Emperor planned on sending invasion fleets larger than any seen in centuries to blockade the rebellious
              worlds of <a href="#">Mon Cala</a> and <a
                href="#">Chandrila</a> until the Death Star could destroy them,
              effectively ending any hope the galaxy may have in defeating the Empire and its tyrannical regime.</p>

          <!-- Destruction -->
          <li id="Partie22" class="tabs-pane" data-tabs-pane>
            <p>Planning to draw the Alliance into a doomed attack against the newer battle station, large portions of
              the <a href="#">Imperial Starfleet</a> began massing in the <a
                href="#">Hudalla system</a> in preparations for the upcoming
              engagement. After members of the <a
                href="#">Rebel Alliance Starfighter
                Corps</a> under <a href="#">Corona Squadron</a> arrived in
              the system, the Empire immediately sent several <a
                href="#">TIE/LN starfighters</a> to destroy the vessels.
              Nonetheless, several ships managed to escape and bring their intel back to <a
                href="#">Alliance High Command</a>, which received
              further information given to them from the <a href="#">Bothan
                spynet</a> regarding the Death Star's presumed capabilities, all which was purposely leaked by
              Palpatine. In an effort to allow its <a href="#">scattered
                fleet</a> time to assemble over the Outer Rim world of <a
                href="#">Sullust</a>, the Alliance embarked on <a
                href="#">Operation Yellow Moon</a> which aimed to
              distract the Imperials of the buildup until it was too late.</p>
            <p>With the station under construction over <a href="#">Endor</a> when <a
                href="#">Emperor</a> <a
                href="#">Palpatine</a> personally oversaw parts of the
              station's construction, the Rebel Alliance could not resist the opportunity to destroy not only the
              Empire's newest superweapon, but also its head of state. In reality, the Emperor was leading the Rebels
              into a trap, resulting in the <a href="#">Battle of
                Endor</a>. With the station protected on the ground by a <a
                href="#">SLD-26 planetary shield
                generator</a> guarded by elite Imperial stormtroopers, along with the largest gathering of <a
                href="#">Imperial-class Star Destroyers</a>
              in Imperial history and a fully functional superlaser, total victory for the Empire appeared certain.
              Nonetheless, the station was destroyed by <a href="#">Lando
                Calrissian</a>, piloting the <a href="#">Millennium
                Falcon</a> and his wing of starfighters during the battle, after the ground based shield generator was
              destroyed by a small rebel strike team who received assistance from the planet's indigenous population, of
              whom the Empire viewed as no real threat. With the destruction of the second Death Star and Luke
              Skywalker's victory in converting his father, <a
                href="#">Darth Vader</a>—once more Anakin Skywalker—to
              hurl his master down a reactor shaft, the rebels managed not only to prevent further destruction, but
              presumably end the Empire's oppressive reign once and for all.</p>

            <p>Following the destruction of the second Death Star, Imperial records would be sent into a state of
              disarray, with numerous missing persons and unconfirmed dead or wounded.[5] With several thousand death
              notices to write and records to update, the task would be pushed to the side of Imperial priorities in the
              days after Endor as the Rebel Alliance would capitalize on its stunning victory by pushing the shattered
              Imperial forces off of many worlds across the galaxy, including the Emperor's homeworld of <a
                href="#">Naboo</a>, one of the first to fall. Holovids of the
              station's destruction would be disseminated across star systems while the Empire would root out and punish
              those responsible in spreading what it defined treasonous lies. Nonetheless, the truth of the station's
              destruction would eventually become known to the general citizenry, while both the Death Star I and II
              would continue to serve as symbol of fear and oppression for years to come, permanently leaving its mark
              on citizens across the galaxy. With the Empire falling apart, many believed that total victory for the now
              New Republic was imminent. Nonetheless over a year and four days later Imperial remnants would still be
              fighting the Republic for control of the galaxy, most notably during the Empire's last stand in the <a
                href="#">Battle of Jakku</a>. The <a
                href="#">Galactic Concordance</a> would ultimately be
              signed mid-battle, formally ending the <a
                href="#">Galactic Civil War</a> and transforming the
              Empire into a mere rump state.</p>
            <p>Despite the Empire's defeat at the Battle of Jakku and its total surrender, Imperial fanatics and
              technocrats would flee deep into the galaxy's <a
                href="#">Unknown Regions</a> where they would form the
              Empire's first true successor state, the <a href="#">First
                Order</a>. A hermit kingdom led by yet another Force practitioner entranced by the destructive
              capabilities of the original Death Stars, he would ultimately oversee the construction of <a
                href="#">Starkiller Base</a>, a planet-turned <a
                href="#">superweapon</a> capable of destroying star systems
              through <a href="#">sub-hyperspace</a>.</p>
